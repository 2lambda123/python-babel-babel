Messages and Catalogs
=====================

.. module:: babel.messages

Babel provides functionality to work with message catalogs.  There is more
functionality than that available but some of it is currently only
documented in the sourcecode as we have to decide what part of the API
will become public and what should stay internal.

Basic Interface
---------------

.. autoclass:: Message
   :members:

.. autoclass:: Catalog
   :members:

Exceptions
----------

.. autoexception:: TranslationError
