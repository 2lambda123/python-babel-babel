Installing Babel
================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3+ or PyPy
 * CLDR 23
 * other: see setup.py install_requires


Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked a Babel source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

  $ python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install Babel to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.  It's recommended to use a
virtualenv instead.

If you have a git checkout instead of a source release you will need
to convert the CLDR sources:

  $ python setup.py import_cldr install

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

If you encounter any problems with Babel, please don't hesitate to ask
questions on the Pocoo IRC channel (``#pocoo`` on irc.freenode.net).
